## Special issue to this subject
### Jupyter server has lots of issues during our assignment submission process, and there are many students complain about the system
### Most of us wish Unimelb can switch the code evaluation system to gitlab, apparently, this subject stuff did not willing to make a pipeline for the tests
### this one was my complain to the school teaching team

### In 2022, when my students in my tutoring from Unimelb, they have a better coding place now, and Unimelb upgrade all the coding environment on campus

# Project Background ADS
The first assignment get a lowest mark in this subject, but I got feedback relating to the overfitting issue, which means I have to modify parts of my code.

The second assignment gives me confidence about my model training because my totally performance had over 70% F-Score, which means I successfully present good recall and accuracy, also my coding mark is full mark(but been deducted due to some technical issue, and got late submission warning)

# Project Background DOA
The first assignment got full mark, both coding and report were highlighted by head tutor to other students, and I have improved my pandas skills and learnt some machine learning in advance to get good mark on the next assignment and future course - Machine Leaning

The second assignment got full mark for my coding part in all tasks, but lost some marks because my feature engineering approaches.
