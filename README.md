## Special issue to this subject
### Jupyter server has lots of issues during our assignment submission process, and there are many students complain about the system
### Most of us wish Unimelb can switch the code evaluation system to gitlab, apparently, this subject stuff did not willing to make a pipeline for the tests
### this one was my complain to the school teaching team

### In 2022, when my students in my tutoring from Unimelb, they have a better coding place now, and Unimelb upgrade all the coding environment on campus

# Project Background ADS
The first assignment get a lowest mark in this subject, and I have applied for a mark compensation, unfortunately, the mark did not increase that much.

The second assignment gives me more idea about how the tree working, and the searching algorithm will have a big impact on a application performance.
Also, this second project has strengthem my knowledge about algorithm operation.

The final assignment is to play game, and design the simple function to make the peg move and know the implementation time.
can be referenced to this peg play website => [Play Peg](https://pegsolitaire.org/) <br/>
And I did pretty good on this project, thanks to the experiences from first and second assignments, and..... <br />
